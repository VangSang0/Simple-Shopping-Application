This project is for practicing web development as well as using flask.

This part is for design planning. It is like a checklist.

I first started with the homepage to visualize how everything will fall into place.
Next I added a shopping cart tab with functionality making sure that each item will appear in the cart.
The piece I will be working towards next is calculating the total and the quantity of each item that will be purchased since, as of right now, the items are in there multiple times.
After accomplishing the total calculation, I moved onto styling the shopping cart page to make it look more appealing. The next step is to work on the quantity portion.
